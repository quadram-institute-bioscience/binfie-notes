Each markdown file will not have any "header1" section: the title of the page is defined in the header by the `title:` tag. 

Each post needs a nice header image, if you dont have one choose an existing in assets/images

## Then add sections

And you can of course add code snippets as usual:

```bash
for i in *.md;
do
  echo "We have this post here: $i"
done
```

## What can you add?

Add a blog post about:

1) Any useful bioinformatics concept e.g. what is singularity and how to use it
2) A result from your work e.g. comment on a paper or showcase a repository you did
3) A list of resources you like e.g. best packages for X, or top resources to learn Y...
